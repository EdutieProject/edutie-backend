# Edutie backend application

Welcome to the edutie backend application.

### OpenApi docs

To browse open api docs run the app and visit http://localhost:8081/swagger url.

### Run inside docker

Running the app using *docker-compose*:
1. `docker-compose build` - this ensures the codebase is refreshed and up-to-date
2. `docker-compose up`

To run those commands you must be in the exact same folder as the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
