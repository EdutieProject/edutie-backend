# Assessment Schema

Assessment schema is an entity containing all the information needed to assess the student's work, producing
a Learning Result.

## Contained data:

### Solution submission

It must be embedded into the schema, so we know what to assess. 

### Assessment Problem descriptors
Assessment problem descriptor is derived from Learning Resource so the assessment process accounts for
the amount of sub requirements from each learning requirement.

Therefore, it consists of:
 - Learning Requirement
 - Amount of qualified sub requirements
