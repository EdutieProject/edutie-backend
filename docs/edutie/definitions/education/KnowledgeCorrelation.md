# Knowledge Correlation

Knowledge Correlation is an entity indicating learning requirement's knowledge subject (wiki page) relation to other
knowledge subjects.
It does not typically occur in the singular form. It is used as a response from knowledge map system for getting
knowledge
correlations using given knowledge subject id.

## Contained data:

### Correlated knowledge subject Id

The identifier of the source knowledge subject which correlation is being measured.

### Correlated knowledge subject Id

The identifier of correlated knowledge subject.

### Correlation Factor

The factor that represents how much given subject is correlated.

The less the correlation factor, the more the subject represented by above identity is correlated to the subject that
invoked the flow.
